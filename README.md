# Face Detection using TensorFlow

This project delves into the realm of computer vision and deep learning to tackle the increasingly prevalent issue of distinguishing between real and fake faces. With the proliferation of deepfakes and manipulated images, it has become crucial to develop robust algorithms capable of discerning digital authenticity. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow, this project explores various deep learning models and transfer learning techniques to create a reliable classifier for this purpose.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, the ability to detect manipulated images is essential for maintaining trust and integrity in media content. Deep learning, particularly with frameworks like TensorFlow, offers promising solutions to this challenge. By training models on extensive datasets containing both authentic and manipulated images, we aim to equip our classifier with the ability to accurately identify fake faces while minimizing false positives and negatives.
